    content: \`Best Countries for Entrepreneurs Seeking Residency in 2026

For entrepreneurs thinking long-term, where you live is as important as where you do business. The right residency can reduce your tax burden, expand your banking access, and give you the freedom to operate globally without friction.

## What Makes a Country Entrepreneur-Friendly?

- Low or territorial taxation — keeping more of what you earn
- Ease of company formation — fast, affordable, minimal red tape
- Stable banking infrastructure — access to international accounts
- Visa flexibility — ability to travel freely and bring in talent
- Quality of life — environment matters for long-term productivity

## 1. Portugal

Portugal has become one of the most popular bases for international entrepreneurs.

### Why Entrepreneurs Choose Portugal
- NHR Tax Regime — significant tax advantages for the first 10 years
- D7 and Digital Nomad Visas — multiple pathways to legal residency
- EU access — live in Portugal, operate across the entire European Union
- Low cost of living — compared to Western Europe
- English widely spoken — especially in Lisbon and Porto

### Key Considerations
- Corporate tax rate: 21% (with reductions for SMEs)
- Strong startup ecosystem in Lisbon
- Pathway to EU citizenship after 5 years

## 2. UAE (Dubai)

Dubai remains a global hub for entrepreneurs who want zero personal income tax and world-class infrastructure.

### Why Entrepreneurs Choose Dubai
- 0% personal income tax — keep everything you earn
- Free zones — 100% foreign ownership, full profit repatriation
- World-class banking — access to international financial services
- Strategic location — between Europe, Asia, and Africa
- Fast company setup — some free zones process applications in 24 hours

## 3. Georgia (Tbilisi)

Often overlooked, Georgia has quietly become one of the most entrepreneur-friendly countries in the world.

### Why Entrepreneurs Choose Georgia
- 1% tax on foreign income — under the Virtual Zone status for IT companies
- Easy residency — many nationalities can stay visa-free for a year
- Low cost of living — one of the most affordable capitals in Europe
- Simple company formation — register a company in under a day

## 4. Malta

Malta offers EU residency with a business-friendly environment and English as an official language.

### Why Entrepreneurs Choose Malta
- EU member state — full access to European markets
- Participation Exemption — significant tax benefits on dividends and capital gains
- English-speaking — no language barrier for business
- Strong financial services sector — regulated, reputable jurisdiction

## 5. Singapore

For entrepreneurs targeting Asian markets, Singapore remains the gold standard.

### Why Entrepreneurs Choose Singapore
- Territorial tax system — foreign-sourced income generally exempt
- Ease of doing business — consistently ranked top globally
- World-class banking — access to sophisticated financial products
- Gateway to Southeast Asia — 650 million consumer market nearby

## 6. Estonia

Estonia pioneered digital governance and remains a top choice for location-independent founders.

### Why Entrepreneurs Choose Estonia
- e-Residency — manage an EU company 100% remotely
- Digital-first government — almost everything done online
- Flat 20% corporate tax — only on distributed profits
- Strong tech and startup community in Tallinn

## How to Choose the Right Country

Ask yourself:
- Where are my clients and partners?
- What is my current tax situation?
- Do I need EU access?
- What is my lifestyle preference?
- Do I have family?

## Common Mistakes Entrepreneurs Make

1. **Choosing based on tax alone** — lifestyle and banking matter just as much
2. **Not planning the exit from their home country** — tax residency changes require proper planning
3. **Ignoring banking** — some countries have great tax but poor banking access
4. **Underestimating compliance** — every residency comes with reporting obligations
5. **Moving without professional advice** — the cost of mistakes far exceeds the cost of guidance

    content: \`How to Structure Your International Move Without Disrupting Your Business

Relocating internationally as a founder is not the same as relocating as an employee. You are not just moving your life — you are moving the nerve centre of a business. Done poorly, it can cost you clients, team members, and momentum.

## The Core Challenge

Most entrepreneurs underestimate how interconnected their business is with their physical location. Your banking, contracts, tax filings, team communication, and client relationships all have a geography.

## Phase 1: Pre-Move Planning (3-6 Months Before)

### Audit Your Business Structure
- Where is your company registered?
- Where do you pay corporate tax?
- Where are your bank accounts?
- Which jurisdiction governs your contracts?

### Identify Key Dependencies
- Banking relationships
- Client contracts with jurisdiction clauses
- Employee contracts and obligations
- Intellectual property location
- Tax residency implications

## Phase 2: Legal and Tax Planning (2-4 Months Before)

### Company Structure Options

**Option 1: Redomiciliation**
Move the existing company to a new jurisdiction. The company retains its history, contracts, and identity.

**Option 2: New Company in New Jurisdiction**
Incorporate a new company in the destination country and gradually transfer operations.

**Option 3: Holding Structure**
Create a holding company in the new jurisdiction that owns the existing operating company.

**Option 4: Branch Office**
Establish a branch of the existing company in the new country.

### Intellectual Property
IP is often the most valuable asset in a business. Before relocating:
- Assess where your IP is currently held
- Consider whether IP should be transferred to the new jurisdiction
- Understand the tax implications of IP transfers

### Contracts
Review all existing contracts for:
- Governing law clauses
- Change of control provisions
- Address and jurisdiction references

## Tax Considerations

### Corporate Tax Rates by Country

| Country | Corporate Tax Rate |
|---------|-------------------|
| UAE (Free Zone) | 0% |
| Georgia | 15% (0% for Virtual Zone IT) |
| Ireland | 12.5% |
| Portugal | 21% |
| UK | 25% |

### Exit Tax
Many countries impose an exit tax when a company or individual leaves. This can be a significant cost that must be planned for in advance.

## Banking Considerations

Banking is consistently the most underestimated challenge in business relocation.

### Opening Business Accounts
Plan for:
- **Timeline**: Account opening can take 1-3 months
- **Documentation**: Extensive company and personal documentation required
- **Relationships**: Having a local contact or advisor helps significantly

## Employment Considerations

### Existing Employees
- Review employment contracts for jurisdiction-specific protections
- Understand your obligations under local employment law
- Plan for potential redundancy costs if roles are eliminated

### Contractor vs. Employee
In many international relocations, founders shift from employees to contractors. This can simplify compliance but must be done carefully.

## Practical Timeline

A typical business relocation takes 6-18 months:

- **Months 1-2**: Planning and professional advice
- **Months 3-4**: Company formation and banking setup
- **Months 5-6**: Gradual transfer of operations and contracts
- **Months 7-9**: Tax residency change for founder
- **Months 10-12**: Full transition and closure of old structures

## Choosing the Right Advisors

A business relocation requires a team:
- **Immigration consultant** — for founder and key employee visas
- **International tax advisor** — for corporate and personal tax planning
- **Corporate lawyer** — for company formation and contract review
- **Local accountant** — in the destination country

    content: \`Citizenship by Investment: How It Works in 2026

Citizenship by Investment (CBI) is one of the most powerful tools available to high-net-worth individuals seeking global mobility, security, and opportunity.

## What is Citizenship by Investment?

CBI is a legal process by which a country grants citizenship to foreign nationals in exchange for a qualifying investment. The investment typically takes one of several forms:

- Non-refundable donation to a national development fund
- Real estate purchase in approved developments
- Business investment creating local employment
- Government bonds or approved financial instruments

## The Major CBI Programmes in 2026

### Caribbean Programmes

**St. Kitts and Nevis** — The oldest CBI programme in the world (since 1984)
- Minimum investment: \$150,000
- Processing time: 4-6 months
- Visa-free access: 156+ countries

**Dominica** — Consistently the most affordable option
- Minimum investment: \$100,000
- Processing time: 3-4 months
- Visa-free access: 140+ countries

**Grenada** — The only Caribbean CBI with US E-2 treaty access
- Minimum investment: \$150,000
- Processing time: 4-6 months
- Visa-free access: 140+ countries

- Minimum investment: 600,000 EUR+
- Processing time: 12-14 months
- Benefit: Full EU citizenship and passport

**Turkey** — Popular for its accessibility
- Minimum investment: \$400,000 (real estate)
- Processing time: 3-6 months

## The Application Process

### Step 1: Eligibility Assessment
- Clean criminal record
- Clean financial history (no sanctions)
- Good health
- Legitimate source of funds

### Step 2: Document Preparation
- Certified copies of passports
- Birth and marriage certificates (apostilled)
- Police clearance certificates
- Bank statements and proof of source of funds
- Medical examination reports

### Step 3: Due Diligence
The government conducts thorough background checks through:
- International databases (Interpol, World-Check)
- Financial intelligence checks
- Media and reputational screening
- Verification of all submitted documents

### Step 4: Investment
Once approved in principle, you make the qualifying investment.

### Step 5: Passport Issuance
After investment confirmation, citizenship is granted and passports are issued within 2-4 weeks.

## What Has Changed in 2026

- Increased due diligence standards — unified CARICOM framework
- Higher investment thresholds — several programmes have increased minimums
- Digital application processes — reducing processing times
- Stricter source of funds requirements — more detailed documentation required

## Who is CBI Right For?

- Entrepreneurs who need global mobility for business
- Families seeking long-term security and opportunity
- Individuals from countries with weak passports
- High-net-worth individuals seeking tax planning options

    content: \`How Long Does It Really Take to Get a Second Passport?

The timeline for obtaining a second passport varies dramatically depending on which programme you choose. Some can be completed in 3-4 months. Others take 5+ years.

- **Week 5-12**: Government processing and background checks
- **Week 13-16**: Investment completion
- **Week 17-26**: Passport issuance

### What Can Slow You Down

- Incomplete documentation
- Delays in obtaining police clearance certificates
- Complex source of funds verification
- Media or reputational issues requiring clarification
- Delays in investment completion

## European Residency (Medium Timeline)

### Portugal D7 Visa: 60-90 days
- Document preparation: 2-4 weeks
- Application submission: 1 day
- Government processing: 60-90 days

### Portugal Golden Visa: 90-120 days
- Document preparation: 2-4 weeks

- Government processing: 90-120 days

### Malta Residency: 30-60 days
- Document preparation: 1-2 weeks
- Application submission: 1 day

- Apply for citizenship
- Processing: 6-12 months

## The Hybrid Strategy (Recommended)

Many clients use both pathways:

1. **Obtain Caribbean CBI passport** (3-6 months) — immediate global mobility
2. **Simultaneously apply for European residency** (60-120 days) — EU access
3. **After 5 years, apply for EU citizenship** — full EU passport

**Total timeline to two passports:** 5 years (with Caribbean passport in hand from month 6)

## Factors That Affect Timeline

### Speed Up Your Application

- Prepare documents thoroughly before submission
- Use an experienced agent who knows the process
- Respond immediately to any information requests
- Complete investment quickly once approved

### Slow Down Your Application

- Incomplete or incorrect documentation
- Delays in obtaining certificates from your home country
- Complex source of funds requiring extensive verification
- Changes in personal circumstances during processing
- Media or reputational issues

## Timeline Comparison Table

| Programme | Fastest | Typical | Slowest |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| Caribbean CBI | 3 months | 4-5 months | 6+ months |
| Portugal Residency | 60 days | 90 days | 120+ days |
| EU Citizenship | 5 years | 5-6 years | 8+ years |

## The Bottom Line

If you need a passport **now**, Caribbean CBI is your only option (3-6 months).

If you can wait **1-2 years**, European residency followed by eventual citizenship is more cost-effective.

If you want **EU citizenship specifically**, plan for 5+ years through the residency-first pathway.

    content: \`Residency vs. Citizenship: Which Path Should You Choose?

One of the most common questions we receive is: "Should I pursue residency or citizenship?"

The answer depends entirely on your goals, timeline, and circumstances. Let's break down the key differences.

## What is Residency?

Residency is legal permission to live in a country. It does not make you a citizen.

**What residency gives you:**
- Legal right to live in the country
- Access to public services (healthcare, education)
- Ability to work and do business
- Tax residency status (for tax purposes)
- Pathway to eventual citizenship (in most countries)

**What residency does NOT give you:**
- A passport
- Voting rights
- Diplomatic protection
- Automatic right to pass status to children

## What is Citizenship?

Citizenship is a legal bond between you and a country. You are a member of that nation.

**What citizenship gives you:**
- A passport
- Voting rights
- Diplomatic protection abroad
- Ability to pass citizenship to children
- Permanent, unconditional status
- Access to all public services

**What citizenship does NOT require:**
- Living in the country (in most cases)
- Speaking the local language
- Renouncing your existing citizenship (in most countries)

## The Two Pathways

### Path 1: Residency to Naturalisation to Citizenship

You obtain legal residency, live there for a required period, and then apply for citizenship.

**Timeline:** 5-14 years depending on the country
**Cost:** Lower upfront, but significant time investment
**Result:** Citizenship in a country where you have genuine ties

### Path 2: Direct Citizenship by Investment

You make a qualifying investment and receive citizenship directly.

**Timeline:** 3-18 months depending on the programme
**Cost:** Higher upfront investment
**Result:** Citizenship and passport without needing to live in the country

## When Residency First Makes Sense

### You Want EU Citizenship

The only way to obtain citizenship in most EU countries is through naturalisation. For most people seeking EU citizenship, the path is: obtain residency, maintain it for 5 years, then apply for citizenship.

### You Plan to Actually Live There

If you genuinely want to relocate to a specific country, the residency-first path makes more sense.

### Budget is a Primary Constraint

Residency programmes are generally less expensive than CBI programmes.

### You Want to Test the Country First

Residency allows you to experience living in a country before committing to citizenship.

## When Direct Citizenship Makes Sense

### You Need a Passport Now

If your primary goal is a stronger travel document within 6-12 months, Caribbean CBI is the only realistic option.

### You Cannot or Will Not Relocate

If your life and business are elsewhere and you cannot commit to living in a new country, direct citizenship is the practical choice.

### You Want Permanent, Unconditional Status

Residency can be lost. Citizenship cannot.

### You Want to Pass Status to Your Children

Citizenship is inheritable. Residency is not.

## The Hybrid Strategy

Many of our clients use both pathways simultaneously:

**Example:**
1. Obtain Caribbean citizenship (Grenada or St. Kitts) for immediate passport benefits — 4-6 months
2. Simultaneously apply for Portuguese residency (D7 or Golden Visa) for EU access
3. After 5 years in Portugal, apply for Portuguese citizenship

This gives you:
- A strong travel passport immediately
- EU residency and tax benefits from year one
- EU citizenship after 5 years
- Two citizenships as the end result

## Key Decision Factors

| Factor | Residency First | Direct Citizenship |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Timeline | 5+ years to citizenship | 3-18 months |
| Cost | Lower upfront | Higher upfront |
| Lifestyle | Planning to relocate | Staying put |
| Goal | EU citizenship | Passport now |

## Common Mistakes

- Choosing residency when you need a passport now — Residency does not give you a passport
- Choosing CBI when you actually want to live there — Caribbean citizenship does not help you live in Portugal
- Not considering the hybrid approach — The two goals are complementary, not competing
- Not considering the hybrid approach — The two goals are complementary, not competing

    content: \`What Governments Actually Check During Due Diligence

Due diligence is the most misunderstood part of the citizenship by investment process. Some applicants fear it unnecessarily. Others underestimate it. Both approaches lead to problems.

## Why Due Diligence Exists

CBI programmes grant citizenship — one of the most powerful legal statuses a country can confer. Governments have a responsibility to ensure that the people they grant citizenship to are not criminals, terrorists, money launderers, or individuals who would damage the country's international reputation.

## Who Conducts Due Diligence?

### The Authorised Agent
Your agent conducts an initial review before submitting your application.

### The Government Processing Unit
The CBI unit within the government reviews your application using government databases and intelligence resources.

### Third-Party Due Diligence Firms
Most Caribbean governments contract specialist due diligence firms with access to databases and investigative capabilities.

### International Intelligence Sharing
Caribbean governments share information with international partners including the UK, USA, Canada, and Interpol.

## What They Actually Check

### Criminal Records
- Criminal convictions in your country of birth
- Criminal convictions in all countries where you have lived
- Pending criminal charges or investigations
- Interpol red notices or diffusions

**What disqualifies you:** Fraud, money laundering, drug offences, violent crimes, and corruption are automatic disqualifiers.

### Financial Background
- Bankruptcy or insolvency history
- Involvement in financial fraud
- Sanctions (OFAC, EU, UN, UK)
- Politically Exposed Person (PEP) status
- Adverse media coverage related to financial misconduct

### Source of Funds
Governments want to know:
- Where did the investment funds come from?
- Is the source of funds legitimate?
- Is there any connection to money laundering?

**Red flags:**
- Funds that appeared suddenly without explanation
- Funds from high-risk jurisdictions
- Complex layering of funds through multiple entities

### Business and Professional Background
- Your business history and current activities
- Any involvement in companies that have been investigated or sanctioned
- Regulatory actions against you or your businesses

### Reputational and Media Screening
Third-party firms conduct extensive media searches in multiple languages, looking for:
- Negative news coverage
- Allegations of misconduct (even unproven)
- Association with controversial figures

### Previous Visa Refusals
All visa refusals must be disclosed. Failure to disclose is treated as dishonesty — which is a disqualifier.

## Red Flags That Trigger Deeper Investigation

- Gaps in employment history
- Unexplained changes in net worth
- Business involvement in high-risk sectors
- Connections to individuals with adverse backgrounds
- Inconsistencies in documentation

## How to Prepare for Due Diligence

### Document Everything
- Gather all business records and tax returns
- Prepare detailed explanations of your career history
- Document the source of all funds
- Collect references from professional contacts

### Be Transparent
- Disclose everything, even if it seems minor
- Explain any potential red flags proactively
- Provide context for any adverse information

### Use Professional Representation
- Work with an experienced CBI agent
- Have a lawyer review your application
- Consider a due diligence consultant for complex cases

## What Happens If You Fail Due Diligence?

If your application is rejected during due diligence:
- You receive a written explanation
- You have the right to appeal in most programmes
- Your investment is returned (in most cases)
- You can reapply after addressing the issues

## Timeline for Due Diligence

- **Initial review by agent:** 1-2 weeks
- **Submission to government:** 1 day
- **Government processing:** 4-8 weeks
- **Third-party due diligence:** 2-6 weeks
- **Final approval:** 1-2 weeks

**Total:** 8-16 weeks (2-4 months)

## The Bottom Line

Due diligence is thorough, but it is not designed to be punitive. If you have a clean background and legitimate source of funds, you should have no concerns.

The key is transparency and preparation. Disclose everything upfront, provide clear documentation, and work with experienced professionals.

    content: \`Opening a Bank Account in Europe as a Foreigner: A Complete Guide

Banking is one of the most underestimated challenges for expats relocating to Europe. Many people assume they can open an account quickly. The reality is often more complex.

## Why Banking is Difficult

European banks are heavily regulated. They must comply with:
- Anti-money laundering (AML) regulations
- Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements
- FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act)
- Local data protection laws

This means banks conduct extensive due diligence on every new customer.

## What You Need to Open an Account

### Essential Documents
- Valid passport
- Proof of address (utility bill, rental agreement, or bank statement)
- Tax identification number (NIF in Portugal, NIE in Spain, etc.)
- Proof of income (employment letter, business registration, or pension statement)
- Source of funds documentation (for larger deposits)

### Proof of Address Challenge
This is the biggest hurdle. Most banks require a utility bill or rental agreement in your name. If you just arrived, you may not have these yet.

**Solutions:**
- Ask your landlord for a letter confirming your residency
- Use a temporary address from a co-working space or friend
- Some banks accept a combination of documents (passport + rental agreement + letter from employer)

### Tax Identification Number
You cannot open a bank account without a tax number. Obtaining one typically takes:
- **Portugal (NIF):** 1-2 weeks
- **Spain (NIE):** 2-4 weeks
- **Germany (Steuernummer):** 2-4 weeks

## Timeline for Account Opening

### Traditional Banks: 4-8 weeks
- Document submission: 1-2 weeks
- Due diligence review: 2-4 weeks
- Account activation: 1-2 weeks

### Digital Banks: 1-3 days
- Online application: 30 minutes
- Document verification: 1-2 days
- Account activation: 1 day

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Get Your Tax Number (1-2 weeks)
Visit the local tax office with your passport and proof of address. Processing is usually quick.

### Step 2: Choose Your Bank
Decide between traditional banks and digital banks based on your needs.

### Step 3: Gather Documents
Collect all required documents. Call the bank ahead to confirm the exact list.

### Step 4: Submit Application
Submit your application in person (traditional banks) or online (digital banks).

### Step 5: Due Diligence
The bank reviews your documents and background. This is the longest step.

### Step 6: Account Activation
Once approved, your account is activated and you receive your card.

**Month 2-3:** Apply to a traditional bank for a full-service account
**Month 3+:** Use traditional bank for main banking, digital bank for international transfers

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Bringing insufficient documentation** — Call ahead to confirm exactly what is needed

    content: \`Common Relocation Mistakes Expats Make (And How to Avoid Them)

After helping hundreds of clients relocate internationally, we have seen the same mistakes made over and over again. Some are minor inconveniences. Others are costly, time-consuming, and occasionally irreversible.

## Mistake 1: Not Planning the Tax Transition

**The mistake:** Moving to a new country without properly planning the tax implications.

**The consequences:**
- Dual tax residency — paying taxes in two countries simultaneously
- Exit taxes that were not anticipated
- Missing tax benefits (like Portugal's NHR) because the application deadline was missed

**How to avoid it:**
- Consult an international tax advisor before you move, not after
- Plan your exit from your home country carefully
- Apply for any available tax regimes as soon as you are eligible

## Mistake 2: Underestimating the Banking Challenge

**The mistake:** Assuming you can open a bank account quickly and easily in your new country.

**The consequences:**
- Unable to pay rent or utilities
- Cannot receive salary or pension payments
- Delays in getting settled

**How to avoid it:**
- Get your tax number (NIF, NIE, etc.) as early as possible
- Open a digital bank account (Wise, Revolut) immediately as a bridge
- Allow 4-8 weeks for traditional bank account opening

## Mistake 3: Moving Without a Visa or Residency Plan

**The mistake:** Moving to a country on a tourist visa with a vague plan to sort out the paperwork later.

**The consequences:**
- Overstaying visa-free periods (illegal and can result in bans)
- Unable to open bank accounts or sign leases without legal status
- Forced to leave the country to apply for the correct visa

**How to avoid it:**
- Research visa requirements before you move
- Apply for the appropriate visa before you arrive
- Work with an immigration consultant if the process is complex

## Mistake 4: Choosing a Location Based on One Visit

**The mistake:** Visiting a place once (often during a holiday) and deciding to move there permanently.

**The consequences:**
- Discovering that the reality of daily life does not match the holiday experience
- Finding that infrastructure or services do not meet your needs

**How to avoid it:**
- Visit at different times of year (including off-season)
- Stay for at least 2-4 weeks in a rental property, not a hotel
- Talk to other expats who live there year-round

## Mistake 5: Not Researching Healthcare

**The mistake:** Moving to a new country without understanding the healthcare system.

**The consequences:**
- Unexpected medical bills
- Difficulty accessing specialists
- Stress during health emergencies

**How to avoid it:**
- Research the public healthcare system in your destination
- Take out private health insurance before you arrive
- Research the nearest hospitals and specialists to your new home

## Mistake 6: Shipping Everything

**The mistake:** Shipping all your belongings to your new country before you have settled in.

**The consequences:**
- Expensive shipping costs for items you end up not wanting
- Customs duties and import taxes on shipped goods

**How to avoid it:**
- Ship only what you genuinely need and cannot replace locally
- Consider selling items and buying new ones in your destination
- Use storage in your home country for items you are unsure about

## Mistake 7: Ignoring the Language

**The mistake:** Moving to a non-English-speaking country with no plan to learn the local language.

**The consequences:**
- Difficulty navigating bureaucracy
- Social isolation outside the expat bubble
- Practical difficulties in emergencies

**How to avoid it:**
- Start learning the local language before you move
- Take formal language classes after arrival
- Use language learning apps (Duolingo, Babbel) for daily practice

## Mistake 8: Not Building a Local Support Network

**The mistake:** Relying entirely on the expat community and not building relationships with locals.

**How to avoid it:**
- Join local clubs, sports teams, or community groups
- Attend local events and festivals
- Be patient — building genuine local friendships takes time

## Mistake 9: Not Having an Emergency Plan

**The mistake:** Moving abroad without thinking about what happens if things go wrong.

**How to avoid it:**
- Maintain an emergency fund in an accessible account
- Keep a valid passport and travel documents accessible
- Register with your home country's embassy in your destination

## Mistake 10: Doing It Alone

**The mistake:** Trying to manage the entire relocation process without professional help.

**The consequences:**
- Costly mistakes that far exceed the cost of professional advice
- Missed opportunities (tax benefits, better visa options)

**How to avoid it:**
- Work with an immigration consultant for visa and residency applications
- Consult an international tax advisor before making any moves
- Connect with other expats who have been through the process
